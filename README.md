# Challenge: Front-End
Simple checkout app consisting of 3 screens: cart, payment and order confirmation. Build using React and Redux.

# Running Locally
The app was created using `create-react-app`, so to start it locally clone the repository and run the following commands on its root folder:

```bash
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```

A new tab should open on your preferred browser showing the cart page.

* `react` - JavaScript framework
* `react-dom` - DOM-specific methods for React
